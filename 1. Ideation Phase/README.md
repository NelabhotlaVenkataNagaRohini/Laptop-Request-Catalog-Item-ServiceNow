# Ideation Phase

## 🧠 Problem Identification
In many organizations, laptop requests are handled manually through emails or verbal communication. This results in delays, incomplete information, and lack of tracking.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Develop a ServiceNow Service Catalog item called "Laptop Request" that allows employees to request laptops in a structured and automated manner.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide a standardized request form
- Implement dynamic field behavior
- Ensure mandatory data collection
- Add form reset functionality
- Track all changes using Update Sets

This phase focuses on understanding the problem and proposing a structured digital solution.
