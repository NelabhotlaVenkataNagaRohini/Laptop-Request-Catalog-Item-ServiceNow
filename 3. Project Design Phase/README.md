# Project Design Phase

##  System Architecture
The project is designed using the ServiceNow platform with the following components:
- Service Catalog
- Catalog Item
- Variables
- Catalog UI Policy
- UI Policy Action
- UI Action
- Update Sets

##  Workflow Design
1. User opens Service Catalog.
2. Selects "Laptop Request Project".
3. Fills in required details.
4. If "Additional Accessories" is selected:
   - "Accessories Details" becomes visible.
   - Field becomes mandatory.
5. User submits the form.
6. Reset button clears form fields when clicked.

This phase ensures proper logical and structural design before implementation.
